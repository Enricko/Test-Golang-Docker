## Hephaestus-Go



#### Hephaestus, the creator of Zeus’ thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident, and more.
#### The Hephaestus-Go app is a program that auto-generates the Golang environment for rapid deployment of web apps.
#### The goal is to minimize setup time on a new machine or virtual machine, such as AWS ec2 instances. 
#### Users will be able to customize the environment to better suit their needs.
#### Personally, I use VIM on Linux, and I waste time setting up the environments for launching web apps.
#### with Hephaestus-Go I just run one program and the tedious redundant code is done!

## Updates

#### As time goes on, I will be updating and adding more complexity and customization.

## Using Hephaestus-Go
#### Download HephaestusGo.go file and run it like any other gofile. (only option 1 works rn)
#### Select option 1 and enter the amount of html pages you want.
#### once the program is done you will need to run: $go mod init <name>  
#### you should also remove the HephaestusGo.go from your directory to prevent multiple mains error in Docker.
#### run the docker file and the rest is history!!!
