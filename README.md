## Hephaestus-Go

#### Hephaestus, the creator of Zeus’ thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident, and more.
#### The Hephaestus-Go app is a program that auto-generates the Golang environment for rapid deployment of web apps.
#### The goal is to minimize setup time on a new machine or virtual machine, such as AWS ec2 instances. 
#### Users will be able to customize the environment to better suit their needs.
#### Personally, I use VIM on Linux, and I waste time setting up the environments for launching web apps.
#### with Hephaestus-Go I just run one program and the tedious redundant code is done!

### Updates

#### As time goes on, I will be updating and adding more complexity and customization
